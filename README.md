# us-visa-time-lookup
Small script that looks up US Visa vaiting times from all cities, sorts put by ascending time and outputs into a file.

Codes for visa type are not currently set up. (I haven't figured the order in the data)

Default is Interview required B1/B2 visa.

File visas_us_visitor/"visa data.py" is the actual script.

File visas_us_visitor/codes has information of city codes used by the US visa system, updated in early 2022.

File visas_us_visitor/answers.txt has an example of the output.
